# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

This repository contains exercises and projects for learning **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, an essential skill for data professionals such as **Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Data Engineers**. These exercises cover fundamental to advanced SQL concepts through hands-on practice.  

## Course Overview  

SQL is widely used for extracting and manipulating data stored in databases. This repository provides a structured approach to mastering SQL, covering topics such as:  

- Writing foundational SQL statements: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.  
- Filtering and manipulating result sets with `WHERE`, `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, and `LIMIT`.  
- Understanding **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** and **DDL (Data Definition Language)**.  
- Creating, modifying, and deleting tables using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.  
- Applying string patterns, ranges, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and built-in functions.  
- Constructing subqueries and retrieving data from multiple tables.  
- Working with SQL and Python in **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
- Exploring advanced topics: **Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, and JOINs**.
